# 1. Document Architecture Decisions
   Date: 2022-08-29

   Status: `Accepted`

# 2. Context

Applications increase in complexity over time. Staff developers come and go. Memory fades. It will
be helpful to preserve the rationale for impactful architecture decisions as [Architecture Decision Records](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record) (ADRs)
for future audiences. 
Additionally, the process of composing and approving an ADR can help clarify issues and achieve clear consensus
amongst application stakeholders.

# 3. Decision

Impactful architecture decisions will be documented in this fashion and approved by the technical lead for the project.
Each ADR should take the form of a new branch and merge request that is reviewed and approved like code changes.

# 4. Consequences

This process may impose additional time requirements on the tech lead and development team for a project. Confusion may
exist over the scope of decision-making that will require the production and approval of an ADR. Additional guidelines 
for meta-ADR issues may need to be added to general development team best practices.
